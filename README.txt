Simple image processing application with a text user interface.

To compile, you can just enter 'make' at the command line, or use g++ -std=c++11

Images to be processed should be in the same directory as the executable.

File Index:

Image Editor -- the executable image editing application
Makefile -- the makefile used to compile source code
main.cpp -- the main function of the application; contains user interface
image.h -- header file declaring image processing functions
image.cpp -- defines image processing functions declared in image.h
sample_images -- a set of sample images illustrating the 10 available processes
